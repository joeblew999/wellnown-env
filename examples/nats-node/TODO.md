CLAUDE : Ignore this !!

Now add the via gui for it to help any 5 years old run it and task it through its lifecles fully. The GUI is reactive so that all tabs update. It needs to reflect the lifecylcs and match what the nats cli and nats cli can do, but when the Via Web GUI.  You have used Via in the via-embed project but this must be designed to work with our nats-node which is a true full bown nats system. This will allow use to then plug this into any Project, so make sure the via golang code is designed that way with a pkg and then being used by the main.go. This will then mean that Devs can use the task file and users can use the via GUI. All users and lifecylces covered in one thing !

The Via GUI uses NATS itself for logging and etc. Its essnetially using the NATS auth system.  So you need login, login out, and then depending on what lifecycle, users can modify the auth of the system. SO its doing what devs do via the nats cli and nsc cli, allowing them to do the same things.
